# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Breif Description

In this project we will try to use the movies DB API to fetch most popular movies and display it on the front end.
We use Bootstrap 5 to display the data fetched from API on the frontend.

## Note:
1)use npm install.
2)use npm install @mui/icons-material.

BIG NOTE:
The project will run locally but its API's will not work because moviesDB as of 26/09/2024 doesnt work in Asia/India.
This project is hence abondanded and the corresponding CSS styling is also broken as the project was migrated from Create React App to Next js 14
